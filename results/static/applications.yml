- title: CO<sub>2</sub> capture and sequestration (coal power plant)
  x: Gravimetric working capacity (coal)
  y: CO2 parasitic energy (coal)
  wx: 100
  wy: -1
  descr: >
    In this model we consider a dry flue gas outlet of a coal power plant (14% CO<sub>2</sub>, 86% N<sub>2</sub>)
    processed to obtain a CO<sub>2</sub> rich mixture, that is later compressed to 150 bar for underground storage. 
    The operative cost of this process is the parasitic energy per kg of CO<sub>2</sub> sequestrated. 
    This metric can be used to compare the performance of physical separation in porous materials with the performance 
    of ammine-based scrubbing processes, which have a parasitic energy around 1 MJ/kg. 
    The second key performance parameter is the working capacity, where a larger one will require for less cycles
    and/or adsorbent material to achieve a same productivity.

    The model for the temperature-pressure swing adsorption has been previously used to screen
    zeolites <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nmat3336" target="_blank">[Smit2012]</a>,
    MOFs <a href="https://doi.org/10.1039/C4EE02636E" target="_blank">[Smit2014]</a>,
    and COFs <a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acscentsci.9b00619" target="_blank">[Smit2019]</a>.
    High-performing materials for physical adsorption separations are characterized by low parasitic energy but also
    high working capacity, which allows to use less material to process the same amount of mixture.

    Similar to the CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration process, but considering the flue gas from the combustion of natural gas,
    which has a 4% concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> over nitrogen.

- title: H<sub>2</sub> storage at near-ambient temperature

  y: Working capacity g/L (5-100bar/298-198K)
  wx: 0
  wy: 1
  descr: >
    For hydrogen storage at near-ambient temperature, we consider a working capacity for loading at 100bar/198K (-75Â°C)
    and discharge at 5bar/298K.
    The performance for this applications can be compared with the record value of 23.0 g/L, obtained experimentally
    for MOF Ni<sub>2</sub>(<i>m</i>-dobdc) <a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.chemmater.8b03276" target="_blank">[Long2018]</a>.
    Current technologies for H<sub>2</sub>-fuel vehicles use compression up to 700 bar 
    that guarantee a working capacity of 37 g/L at ambient temperature.
    The <a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/fuelcells/doe-technical-targets-onboard-hydrogen-storage-light-duty-vehicles" target="_blank">US DOE technical target for onboard storage for vehicles</a>
    is set to 30 g/L.

  wy: 1
  descr: >
    For hydrogen cryogenic storage (77K) we consider a working capacity for loading at 100bar and discharge at 5 (or 1) bar.
    Previous screening on MOFs, gave the following top performer values:
    <ul>
        <li> up to 50 g/L (simulations, 100-2 bar, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.6b08729" target="_blank">Snurr2016</a>)

        <li> 35.5 g/L (PCN-610/NU-100, experimental, 100-5bar, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-09365-w" target="_blank">Siegel2019</a>)

- title: Methane storage at ambient temperature
  x: Geometric Void Fraction
  y: Working capacity vol. (5.8-65bar/298K)
  wx: 0
  wy: 1
  descr: >
    The Advanced Project Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) of the American Departement of Energy (DOE) sets the target for adsorbed methane
    storage at 315 vSTP/v (i.e., volume of methane at ambient pressure/temperature per volume of adsorbent), for 
    a loading pressure of 65 bar and a discharge pressure of 5.8 bar.
    Such a high deliverable capacity would be able to outperform compressed storage at 250 bar (energy density of 9 MJ/L), 
    already considering a packing loss of 25% for the adsorbent.
    <br>
    Previous screenings of >650,000 materials (MOFs, COFs and zeolites) showed that this target is well above the top performers. 
    However, one can still achieve methane storage up to 200 vSTP/v (for comparison, an empty tank at the same conditions can store only 62 vSTP/v)

- title: Oxygen storage at ambient temperature
  x: Geometric Void Fraction
  y: Working capacity vol. (5-140bar/298K)
  wx: 0
  wy: 1
  descr: >
    Oxygen is typically stored in tanks at 200 bar, with a volumentric working capacity of ca. 189 vSTP/v,
    considering the discharge at 5bar.
    The screening study of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-018-03892-8" target="_blank">Fairen-Jimenez et al.</a>
    allowed to find that the MOF UMCM-152 is able to store 249 vSTP/v of O<sub>2</sub> in the 5-140 bar range at 298K.
    Experimental measurements on the synthesized material confirmed the accuracy of computational simulations, 
    proclaming UMCM-152 a world-recor holding materials for oxygen storage.


- title: Xe/Kr separation
  x: Xe adsorption energy
  y: Xe/Kr selectivity @ 298K
  wx: 0
  wy: 1
  descr: >
    In this model we consider the separation of xenon and krypton from the flue gas of used nuclear fuel reporcessing utilities.
    In particular, we seek the best materials that can selectivity extract xenon from diluted concentaration, 
    exploting the larger diameter of Xe (3.92 Angs) with respect to Kr (3.68 Angs). 
    The selectivity here, is defined as the ratio between the Henry coefficients (k<sub>H</sub>) of the two gasses,
    i.e., the affinity of the gas molecule with the bare material at null pressure.
    <br>
    Using this metric, SBMOF-1 was found from computational screenings to have a Xe/Kr selectivity as high as 70.6,
    and it was proved experimentally to be an excellent material for xenon extraction,
    <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms11831" target="_blank">[Smit2016]</a>.


- title: H<sub>2</sub>S separation
  x: H2S Henry coefficient
  y: H2S/H2O selectivity @ 298K

  wy: 10
  descr: >
    The removal of hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) from different stream mixtures 
    (e.g., natural gas or post-combustion flue gas) 
    is of key importance due to its highly toxic and corrosive characteristics. 
    The low concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>S and its similarity with water requires to find materials with high 
    H<sub>2</sub>S selectivity: in the scientific literature metal oxides, MOFs, zeolites, carbons and 
    composite materials have been evaluated for this purpose 
    (see <a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.chemrev.7b00095" target="_blank">[Siepmann2017]</a>).
    <br>
    For this evaluation, we rank nanoporous materials according to their H<sub>2</sub>S/H<sub>2</sub>O selectivity at
    infinite dilution of both molecules in the stream mixture.


# - title: CH<sub>4</sub> separation from air
#   x: CH4 Henry coefficient
#   y: CH4/N2 selectivity @ 298K
#   wx: -1
#   wy: 10
#   descr: >
#     As reported in recent studies, methane is estimated to be <i>the dominant anthropogenic greenhouse gas after CO<sub>2</sub></i> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41893-019-0299-x" target="_blank">[Jackson2019]</a>.
#     Indeed, it is <i>84 times more potent than CO<sub>2</sub> over the first 20 years after release</i> but its concentration in air 200-times lower than CO<sub>2</sub>.
#     This makes methane capture particularly challenging and calls for materials with exceptional methane selectivity over nitrogen.
#     [DEPRECATED]: it is not much realistic to consider N2 in diluted concentration.
